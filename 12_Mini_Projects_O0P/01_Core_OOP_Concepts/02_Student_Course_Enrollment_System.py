OOP Mini Project Number 2
Category: Core OOP Concepts

2.	Design a Student and Course class with enrollment logic.

Problem Statement:
------------------
Design a Student and Course class with enrollment logic.

Requirements:
-------------
1. Create a Student class that stores:
   - name
   - student ID
   - courses the student is enrolled in

2. Create a Course class that stores:
   - course name
   - course code
   - list of enrolled students

3. A student should be able to enroll in multiple courses.
4. A course should keep track of multiple students.
5. We should be able to:
   - Show all courses a student is enrolled in.
   - Show all students enrolled in a course.

Concepts Demonstrated:
----------------------
- Classes and Objects (OOP fundamentals)
- Encapsulation (storing student & course details safely)
- Object Relationships (Student ‚Üî Course link each other)
